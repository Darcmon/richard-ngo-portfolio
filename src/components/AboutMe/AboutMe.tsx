        <span>
          I've worked over 6 years in the mental health service industry in
          several roles across many populations. I am a person who can
          empathize, listen, and provide service to anyone in need. Working in
          Toronto through these years has allowed me an opportunity to share the
          knowledge and skills I acquired from school.

          In my most recent role, I earned a chance to use my skills around
          audio and visual design to assist the company communicate with
          consumers, donors, and the community over social media and with a
          podcast.

          Over the pandemic, I decided I wanted to hone my skills with
          technology and try something new. I learned how to code using
          JavaScript, Python, React.js and many other tools. The guidance of
          friends and family allowed me to see the talent I have for programming
          and how I may be able to use what I learned over the years into a new
          field.
